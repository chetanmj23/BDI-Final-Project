## BDI-FINAL_PROJECT

The project aims at building neural translator that converts Italin to English.
As part of Big Data, there are state-of-the-art Neural machine Translators. In order to understand the essence of training time and the complexity of the model, this is an attempt to build such engine.
Several experiments have been done to understand the changes in model depending on each parameter and the relevant analysis has been done to vote the best model with less training time.
